# img-blur-index

Calculating image blur adapted from [insert ref here & below links] to determine how much selective plane illumination microscopy (SPIM) data to crop.  Uses Fiji/ImageJ FFT, and thresholds 3 std dev above the mean background to determine area.  Here this area is used as an index of blur.
